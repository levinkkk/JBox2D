Todo:

[ ] Update entire engine from the current Box2D build
[ ] Add block solver from latest SVN
[ ] Volume preserving soft-body code
[ ] SPH liquids (demo working now!)
[ ] Finish up TOI joint alterations
	- All warm starting vars must be set/stored similar to the way it happens in RevoluteJoint.java
	- Maker sure everything is stable

[ ] Optimize 
	- See Profiling.txt for bottleneck rundown
    - Vec2 creations mostly taken care of, but CCD still has a lot
	- Trig function calls should be replaced with lookup table (or not? profile...)
	- Consider moving away from Processing for Testbed, it's not optimized for games (maybe to PulpCore?)

Done:
[x] cut down Vec2 creations by half or more, increase in speed
[X] Fix contact ID bug with poly/circle
[x] Fix swept AABB bug, get CCD working right
[x] Finish testbed update
[x] Finish bringing examples over to 2.0
[x] Convert Box2d doc format to Javadoc
